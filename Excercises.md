3.Excercise:
Your program takes a user input which is a number. Let's call this number n. 
Then an array with the size of n should be created, which contains the word "Salam" in each cell.                        

4th Excercise:                        
Your program takes an user input which is a number. The number shall be called n. 
Then an array of size n should be created filled with numbers 1 to n in increasing order.

5th Excercise:
Same as excercise 4 but in decreasing order from n to 1.

Ex6: 
Write a program which receives a user input. 
If the user input is less than 5, output "Your number is less than 5.". 
Otherwise output "Your numer is bigger than 5."

Ex7: Write a program which asks the user for a number as an input. 
If the number is even, print out "The number is even". Otherwise print out "The number is odd"

Ex 8: Write a program which asks the user for an input. As long as the input is NOT a number, the program says "The input is not a number. Please input a number." Once a number has been inputed, the Program says: "Congratulations. You typed in a number."
