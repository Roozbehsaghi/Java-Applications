	Ex 8: Write a program which asks the user for an input. As long as the input is NOT a number, 
	the program says "The input is not a number. Please input a number." Once a number has been inputed, the Program says: 
	"Congratulations. You typed in a number."
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Please enter a number: ");
		
		boolean key2 = sc.hasNextInt();
		
		if (key2==true){
			System.out.println("Congratulations. You typed in a number.");
		} else {
			System.out.println("The input is not a number");
		}
		}
		
		}
