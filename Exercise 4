4th Excercise:
Your program takes an user input which is a number. The number shall be called n. 
Then an array of size n should be created filled with numbers 1 to n in increasing order.

public class Test {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		int i = 0;
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		
		String[] items = new String[n];
		
		for( i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
			System.out.print(i+" ");
			}
		}
	}
